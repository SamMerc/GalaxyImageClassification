Final Project Marks
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
Clear description of your problem: 5/5

Approach to your problem: 7/10
---A lot of attention paid to describing the k-means clustering
algorithm, but very little in the way of a description of the
different classifiers. Some discussion of them would've been good.


Technical execution: 25/25

Documentation and testing: 4/5
---Some reasonable commenting; test code would've been nice!


Presentation of results: 5/5

Interpretation of results: 7/10
---Reasonable guesses for why the classifier might not have worked
as well as one might've hoped. However, a lot of speculation
going on which generated hypotheses that should've been tested
in some way.

Creativity + critical thinking: 6/10
---I would've liked to have seen a little bit more critical of an
evaluation of prescriptions/hyperparameters given in the litearture
rather than simply trying to use the methods out of the box.
---Similarly, why not look at the failures to try to figure out
why they weren't classified properly?

Overall communication: 5/5
---Solidly written prose, quite clear in the relevant explanations

TOTAL: 64/75

General comments
----------------------------------------
Generally a well-executed project. I also understand that at least
some of you (maybe all of you?) are graduating this term. Congratulations
and best of luck with what's next!
