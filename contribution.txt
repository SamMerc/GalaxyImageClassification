Code : 

- Alex defined the GetImage class functions : __init__,crop,scale
- Samson defined the GetImage class functions : getLabels, patch, makevector
- Samson defined the dictionnary and generated the features
- Michael defined the GetImage class functions : normalize, whiten
- Michael defined the training and test sets, created the multiclass models using sklearn and made the testRMS functions
- Alex and Michael tested the code for various values of the number of pictures, number of patches, k, batch size, number of iterations for the Mini Batch Kmeans algorithm.

Paper:
- Michael worked on the Abstract and helped Samson work on the Methodology and Introduction. Alex worked on writing up the Accuracy for Various Models as well as the Conclusion.
